# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   with no cross-platform support, pipenv may install dependencies that don't work, or not
#   install all needed dependencies.
#Pipfile.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipenv, Poetry generates a poetry.lock file which is recommended to be committed
#   in a version control system (see https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/#commit-your-poetrylock-file-to-version-control).
#   This allows you to lock your project to a specific state of dependencies.
#poetry.lock

# pdm
#   Similar to Pipenv, PDM generates a pdm.lock file which is recommended to be committed
#   in a version control system (see https://pdm-project.org/en/latest/usage/project/#working-with-version-control).
#   This allows you to lock your project to a specific state of dependencies.
#pdm.lock
#   PDM creates a .pdm-python file to store the python path used in the project.
